• Reason for Service Creation

(사진1)

Korean education system is famous for its systematic      structure and high quality. 

Unfortunately, there is also stress on students due to the evaluation method. 

Relative grade makes students feel inferiority complex and cram training makes students can not feel a sense of achievement in their studies. 

We thought how to reduce stress for korean students, and how to use korean education program easly and internationally.

• Service expected effect 

We made app and web service about forum for students who lost interest in studying. 

For students who have lost interest or are unable to focus on their studies, we have created a system where they earn points and raise their level by solving problems, and a platform where they can solve problems posted by schoolteachers and share and communicate with their friends. 

 We choose targets who is stressed by educational system. And we expect to equal access to primary education. We choose this solution based on My experience of tutoring students.
